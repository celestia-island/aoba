# Write Single Station - Slave Mode - Coils (01) Register Type
# Test ID: write_single_station_slave_coils
# Station: ID=1, Type=Coils, Address=0x0000, Length=10
#
# Test: Write operations to coils in slave mode
# Each round writes to a different coil (2, 3, 4) and verifies:
# 1. Status indicator changes to "Syncing"
# 2. Coil shows gray italic during write
# 3. After completion, status returns to "Running"
# 4. Local coil value is updated
# 5. Remote master station sees the change
#
# Test Values (coils are boolean):
# Round 1 - Coil 2: ON (1)
# Round 2 - Coil 3: ON (1)
# Round 3 - Coil 4: OFF (0)
